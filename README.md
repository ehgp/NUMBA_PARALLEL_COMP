# NUMBA_PARALLEL_COMP
Reimplement a Previous Assignment  For an assignment you previously submitted, reimplement the solution with a faster approach.   
Measure the change of timing for the original and revised notebooks  
Submit the original notebook (with timings present in the notebook) and the revised notebook 
(with timings present in the notebook)  Options for improving performance (suggestions; not required):  
•Rewrite the code to perform the same outcome more efficiently •Use numba •Use multiprocessing 
•Use dask •Replace a function call with lambda 
•Replace a for loop with a list comprehension 
•Use a RAM disk 
•Make fewer external function calls (eg faker, random)
